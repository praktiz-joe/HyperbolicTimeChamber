    "# Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Definitions\n",
    "Recursion is a program that calls itself and it's used to solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "> You could use recursive functions to solve recurrence relation problems\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1.2 Types of Recursion\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Head Recursion\n",
    "Tail recursion is when the last operation in the function/program is the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        ...(statements)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    fun(recursive call)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "> Tail recursion is similar to a while loop. Usually in terms of complexity, both are O(N) but in space complexity, recursive calls are O(N) vs loops at O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Tail Recursion\n",
    "Head recursion is when the beginning operation after is the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if n > 0:\n",
    "            fun(recursive call)\n",
    "            ... (statements)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "> In the above example, the outputs are different from the loop output. You may have to modify the conditionals to get the results as in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Tree Recursion\n",
    "Tree recursion is when a recursive funcion/programs call itself more than one time in the code function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if n> 0: \n",
    "        {\n",
    "            print(n)\n",
    "            fun(n-1) # recursive call 1\n",
    "            fun(n-1) # recursive call 2\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "> When you output the recursive calls in a diagram form, you'll se the tree form that it makes with levels and nodes. Usually, this kind of recursive calls are **O(2<sup>N</sup>)**, in terms of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.4 Indirect Recursion\n",
    "Indirect recursion is more than one function/program calling recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def funA(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if n>0:\n",
    "            print(n)\n",
    "            funB(n-1)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "def funB(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if n>1:\n",
    "            print(n)\n",
    "            funA(n/2)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "> As you can see, fun A calls funB and then funB calls funA recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.5 Nested Recursion\n",
    "Nested Recursion is when inside the recursive call, there's another recursive call being made\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fun(n):\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        if n> 100:\n",
    "            return n -10\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return fun(fun(n+11))\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "> The time complexity usually is **O(N<sup>2</sup>)**.\n",
