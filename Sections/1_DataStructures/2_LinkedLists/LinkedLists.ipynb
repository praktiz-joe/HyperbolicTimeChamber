    "> * Reversing a linked list\n",
    "> * Singly vs Doubly Linked Lists\n",
    "> * Two Pointers Linked Lists\n",

    "What is a linked list?\n",
    "> Sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also contaning data (i.e., x|y --> y|r --> r|a)\n",

    "> **Tail**: is the last node of the list\n",
