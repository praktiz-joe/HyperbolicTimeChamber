    "##### Linked lists are an ordered collection of elements, like arrays. The main difference is the implementation process; they utilize pointers and they are used to implement other data structures as well. \n",

    "> * Fast and Slow Pointer\n",
    "> * Reversing a linked list\n",
    "> * Singly vs Doubly Linked Lists\n",
    "> * Two Pointers Linked Lists\n",

    "What is a linked list?\n",
    "> Sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also contaning data (i.e., x|y --> y|r --> r|a)\n",

    "Where is linked lists used?\n",
    "> List, Queue & Stack implementations\n",

    "> Great to create circular lists\n",

    "> Model real world objects like trains\n",

    "> Used in separate chaining to deal with hashing collisions\n",

    "> Used in implementation of adjacency list for graphs\n",

    "#### Terminology\n",
    "> **Head**: is the first node\n",

    "> **Tail**: is the last node of the list\n",

    "in doubly linked lists, each node holds a reference to the next node and to the previous node and also keep head/tail tracking for easy add/removes\n",
